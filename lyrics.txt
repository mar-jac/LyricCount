Now or Never
Just fight it out
Night sky reflects in my eyes
Reaching out to the glowing stars
Time is ticking and bleeding into the future
But I want to be honest with myself
Come clean, Wind direction (ah?)
Change and cause a scene
Keep it real, proof of life (ah?)
Leave a masterpiece
Everybody betray me
No, your finger touched me
Every thing betray me
That 's not it
It won't disappear even if it fades
Hundreds of times, Even millions of times
No matter how many times I get scarred, I won't give up my faith
Proof of existence, always being myself
I gotta make a change
(make a change yeah)
In the distorted world, following the footsteps
Suppress the silent shout
Hundreds of times, Even millions of times
I Find & Create myself
Now or Never
Just fight it out
Break out public pressure
This never ending chain
I'm just tangled up and spinning around
No matter how much I resist, I am still in this world that I don't understand
To be honest with myself
Can not lose
Disrupt Myself and Blow up
But I'll conquer
Never lose
Negative emotions
Fly up and out from this drifting world
Even if I lose sight of myself in the fence that blocks my way
I'll believe in you
Hundreds of times, Even millions of times
No matter how many times I get scarred, I won't give up my faith
Proof of existence, always being myself
I gotta make a change
(make a change yeah)
In the distorted world, following the footsteps
Suppress the silent shout
Hundreds of times, Even millions of times
I Find & Create myself
Life is short, like a Benjamin Button
Images are flashing in my head
No brake, no frame
Solve the broken truth
Blatka blah wow eh
Searching glory like a zombie (Skrrr skrrr)
Find a reason for fighting, turn it back
Nothing to lose, Supa dopa fly
Let's fight to the limit scream louder
Let's Break out Let's Break out oh yeah
Truly, Keep savage
Hundreds of times, Even millions of times
No matter how many times I get scarred, I won't give up my faith
Proof of existence, always myself
I gotta make a change
(make a change yeah)
In the distorted world
Suppress the silent shout
Hundreds of times, Even millions of times
I Find & Create myself
Now or Never
Just fight it out
