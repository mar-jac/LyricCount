[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

LyricCount is a program that analyze the lyrics to your favorite song and it will count how many times a word is used through a HashMap.

  - With the use of one text file is all that it takes!
  - See the results of the frequency in no time!
  - Fast, simple, efficent, and open source!

# New Features!

  - Program lets you use any .txt file that you set up to find lyrics.
  - Program will automatically determine the file extension.
  - It is also not case-sensitive!

Here is my tidbit for it.

> The overriding design goal for Lyric Count
> is to see the numbers to show how much your 
> song comes to life.
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.


### Installation

LyricCount requires [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) v8+ to run.

Install the LyricCount.java file and add the song lyrics to a text file. Click Run in your IDE or command prompt and follow the instructions. Make sure the filename is the same name you've inputed. 
Enjoy and see the magic on the console and the output.txt file!

$ Enter song, artist, and filename.
